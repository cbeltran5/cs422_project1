<h1> Interface Explanation</h1>
<p> I believe this is a good interface because, once things are configured, the whole shower experience is simplified. The only thing the user has to do is select the water pressure. The previous selected water temperature is saved, so the user no longer has to worry about that. The ability to toggle different "apps" is pretty neat as it gives the user something to do while in the shower. Being able to simply toggle them on or off make it simple too. Of course, there would be some option to install more of these apps. One thing I realize I could have done was save the water pressure preference, and then just have the mat in front of the tub alert the system to turn on when the user is standing on it. That would mean the user literally has to do nothing to turn the shower/bath on. </p>
