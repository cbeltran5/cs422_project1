<p>This was my original idea for a configuration panel for the user to save a temperature setting. The idea was that the user could find an appropriate temperature for, say, a warm shower. The user could then save many of these and only have to remember the names, as opposed to remembering the temperature. As the slider move up and down, the label to its right would display the exact temperature, and the gradient in the background would change to reflect the temperature intensity. </p>

<p>This was the original idea for the first panel the user would see. It would list the most recently used temperature configuration, and have a "knob" to control the water pressure. It'd be convenient for the temperature to be the same as the previous shower, and that was the idea behind having that saved configuration there, by default. There is a switch on the bottom right to toggle whether the water is emmitted from the showerhead or the spout.</p>

<p> This is the settings panel. The user can change their language, choose units, and select a backdrop. This design has pretty much stayed the same throughout development. The only thing that changed was that the panels were now buttons that were always shown on the side wall, so the user could always pick what they wanted.</p>
