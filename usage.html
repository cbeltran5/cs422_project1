<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>The user steps into the tub and selects whether they want a shower or bath. The last setting used is set by default. I wanted to move the main panel down/up based on the user's choice, but fabric was being weird and refused to move some of the images. So the main panel is not reachable from the tub position :(</p>
<p>They then move the slider to the desired temperature. If they've showered before, the last used temperature is saved. As the user moves the slider, the gradient on it changes to give feedback to the user about how intense the temperature is with a darker color (red or blue). </p>
<p>They then rotate the "knob" to turn on the water and set the pressure.</p>

<p>They can also select the gear icon to change a few settings. They can set the language to something different, they can change the units for the temperature, and they can select a backdrop for the side wall. The language and backdrop settings are dropdown menu items, and I only present 3-4 options as a static image when it's clicked, and when you click it again, it simulates the user having clicked the first option.</p>

<p>On the right edge of the sidewall, the user can select which apps to display on the sidewall. They can have the facebook app, a weather app, a music app, or a voice recorder app. All I do is display the static image to represent the application panel being displayed when the user selects the app, and removed when the user clicks on the app again. When a user selects an app, its background turns white, and that should look better if the background was actually a clear screen, not just white.</p>
